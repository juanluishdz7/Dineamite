Dineamite
This project asks the user for any diet restrictions they are on and then asks for a specific cuisine the user prefers to eat.  Once those are selected we will call the Edamam API and offer 9 recipes that match those restrictions.  The user can then select one recipe and be taken to a page where all of the ingredients are listed as well as a breakdown of the calories, carbs, protein, fats, and sugar for quick glance.  We also provide a hand selected radio station they can listen to (from Shoutcast API) while the look over the recipe.  From here, they can click on the link to view the entire recipe in another web page.
